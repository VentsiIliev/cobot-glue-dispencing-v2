#     A class to represent a suction cup used in a glue dispensing system.
#
#     This class models a suction cup, which is an essential component used in glue dispensing
#     systems for holding or manipulating objects during the dispensing process. The class includes
#     offsets for the x, y, and z axes to determine the position of the suction cup relative to the main tooltip.
#
#     Attributes:
#         xOffset (int): The x-axis offset (in millimeters) of the suction cup from the main tooltip.
#         yOffset (int): The y-axis offset (in millimeters) of the suction cup from the main tooltip.
#         zOffset (int): The z-axis offset (in millimeters) of the suction cup from the main tooltip.
