class Laser:
    """
    A class to control a laser device via Modbus communication.

    This class allows for controlling a laser by turning it on or off through Modbus commands. It also
    handles platform-dependent configuration for the communication port, automatically detecting
    the appropriate serial port on Linux systems.

    Attributes:
        slave (int): The Modbus slave address for the laser device.
        port (str): The serial port used for communication with the laser device (e.g., COM5 for Windows or dynamically detected on Linux).
        modbusClient (ModbusClient): The instance of the Modbus client used for communication with the laser device.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        """
               Initializes the Laser object by setting up the Modbus slave address, detecting the communication port,
               and initializing the Modbus client.

               The port is detected based on the operating system. If the system is Windows, a predefined port (COM5) is used.
               If the system is Linux, the appropriate port is detected using the `find_ch341_uart_port` method.

               Raises:
                   Exception: If the communication port cannot be detected or the Modbus client cannot be initialized, an exception is raised.
